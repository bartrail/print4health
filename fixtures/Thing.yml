                  I designed this little guys to help with that! Use the Handler to open doors and push button (use the front that is not touching your index finger).
                  I use a retractable lanyard to keep at my belt so I can grap it each time I need it.
                  I hope you`ll enjoy this little gadget :)'

               Version RC2
               Changes from RC1:

               Increased wall thickness (slightly stiffer and more durable)
               Inner wall from 1.5 mm to 2 mm
               Outer wall from 2 mm to 2.5 mm
               The headband is no longer printed compressed - Lower pressure on the temple
               The visor was moved further away from the forehead - This allows a better fit over bigger respirators and protective goggles
               The printed part now has an extension for the visor (the visor curves less than the headband).
               For now, both RC1 and RC2 versions are relevant. RC1 lets you fit more printed parts on a single print bed. However, if maximum yield isn’t the priority, RC2 provides slightly better protection and is more comfortable to wear.'

               Our innovation is inspired by the scarcest product these days, the famous and scarce N95 masks.

               Basically, there is a breakdown in the global stock of this product, and it is a basic necessity, especially for Healthcare personnel who are at the forefront of fighting this disease. In many countries the authorities have also recommended the use of these masks (or similar) on public transport. These masks, despite being effective, also have some problems such as a short lifecycle (about 8 hours), and have another even more serious problem. Respiratory viruses, specifically SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) can live up to 72 hours on different surfaces. This is a problem since using a conventional mask, at the end of the day we would have a high viral/bacterial load trapped within millimeters of our nose and mouth, further exposing ourselves to these dangerous microbes.'

               • Stay home and avoid contact with other people
               • Avoid touching your face with your hands
               • Wash your hands very often

               Note: This model only includes the mask structure (3 pieces) but does not include the required filter to effectively block the spread of the virus. Also, additional isolation measures could be required to properly fit the face without air gaps. Please check the comments for more information shared by other users about the types of filters that could apply to a mask with these characteristics. The effectiveness of P3 particle filters has been mentioned, and probably also HEPA 12/13, but unfortunately we do not have the means of analysis necessary to confirm this with guarantees. Again we remind you to use this model at your own risk.'
